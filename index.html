        I am currently an AI/ML Software Engineer Intern at Trimble, where I am independently developing<br>
        an AI-driven application that combines machine learning, natural language processing, <br>
        and database management to facilitate natural language queries and report generation.<br><br>

        Before that, I was a Full Stack Software Engineer Intern at Microchip Technology for over a year and a half,<br>
        where I was one of the primary developers for a dynamic web application that<br>
        granted the manufacturing team autonomy in configuring their data entry and display pages.<br><br>

        I'm a recent graduate from Oregon Institute of Technology in Software Engineering.<br><br>

        Through my internships, education, certifications, and personal projects,<br>
        I have gained experience and became proficient in the following languages and technologies:</p>
